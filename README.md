About the app: 

This application was built as a team effort between Natalia, Kevin, Mark, Erin and myself. The overall purpose of this application is to assist users in studying different topics. With this application a user can create decks, and cards within the decks. Users can also search for decks and favorite other user decks. 


Some of the highlights of this application is the fact that users can create their account with Auth0 thorugh google or yahoo. Users have the ability to edit and delete decks. They can also keep decks private if they don't want other users looking at their decks.The application has automatic updates making the application a lot smoother!

The implementation of studying cards uses a nuka-caroussel which facilitates the user's experience. With a simple click, users can go back and forth between questions and answers. Another thing a user can do is create multiple cards all at once. It makes for a more effective application and hassle free.
